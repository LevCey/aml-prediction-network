# AML Prediction Network

**Privacy-Preserving Fraud Detection for Financial Institutions**

Built for **Canton Construct Ideathon** - Prediction Markets Track

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions lose **$180B annually** to compliance costs, with **95% false positive rates** in AML systems. Fraudsters share information across dark web networks, but banks cannot coordinate due to:

- **Bank Secrecy Act**: Customer data cannot be shared
- **GDPR/Privacy Laws**: Strict data protection requirements
- **Siloed Systems**: Each bank operates independently
- **Slow Response**: Days/weeks to detect repeat offenders

**Result**: Same fraudsters cycle through multiple banks undetected.

---

## Solution

**AML Prediction Network** leverages **Canton Network** to create a privacy-preserving, collaborative fraud detection system using **prediction markets**.

### Key Features

1. **Privacy-Preserving Pattern Sharing**
   - Banks share fraud patterns, NOT customer PII
   - Canton's selective disclosure ensures compliance
   - Zero-knowledge proofs validate patterns without exposing data

2. **Real-Time Prediction Markets**
   - Banks stake predictions on transaction fraud likelihood
   - Weighted risk scores aggregated across network
   - Incentive alignment: Correct predictions rewarded

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - BSA Section 314(b) compliant
   - GDPR-friendly (no personal data sharing)
   - Immutable audit trail for regulators
   - Auto-SAR filing at threshold

4. **Network Effects**
   - Each new bank increases detection accuracy
   - Collective intelligence grows exponentially
   - First-mover advantage = defensible moat

## How Prediction Markets Work

### Example Scenario

**1. Suspicious Transaction Detected**
```
Customer X: $25K wire to crypto exchange
- First time crypto user
- Account opened 2 weeks ago
- High-risk jurisdiction
```

**2. Market Created**
```
Binary prediction: "Is this fraud?"
Deadline: 24 hours
Initial odds: 50/50
```

**3. Banks Submit Predictions**
```
Bank A: 70% fraud (stakes $100)
Bank B: 30% fraud (stakes $50)
Bank C: 80% fraud (stakes $200)
Bank D: 45% fraud (stakes $75)
```

**4. Weighted Risk Score**
```
(70×100 + 30×50 + 80×200 + 45×75) / 425 = 65%

Action:
- >80% → Auto-block + manual review
- 60-80% → Enhanced due diligence
- <40% → Pass through
```

**5. Resolution & Rewards**
```
Outcome: Confirmed fraud
Winners: Banks A, C (high confidence + correct)
Losers: Banks B, D (penalties applied)
Reputation scores updated
```

## Regulatory Compliance

| Regulation | Challenge | Our Solution |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bank Secrecy Act** | Cannot share customer data | Share patterns, not PII |
| **Section 314(b)** | Requires FinCEN approval | Pre-approved framework with regulator nodes |
| **GDPR** | Right to be forgotten | Personal data stays local, only aggregated patterns shared |
| **KYC Requirements** | Duplicate effort across banks | Optional shared KYC utility with consent |
| **SAR Reporting** | One-way reporting to FinCEN | Bi-directional intelligence + auto-filing |

---

## Business Model

### Target Customers

1. **Tier 1 Banks**: $100K-500K/year → Access to network intelligence
2. **Regional Banks**: $10K-50K/year → Level playing field against big players
3. **Fintechs**: API access fee → Fast KYC/AML onboarding
4. **Regulators**: Free observer nodes → Real-time supervision

### Revenue Streams

- Subscription fees (tiered by institution size)
- Transaction prediction fees
- Pattern tokenization/listing fees
- API access for third-party integrations

### ROI for Banks

- **Cost Savings**: 30% reduction in false positives = $50B+ industry-wide
- **Risk Reduction**: Real-time detection vs. weeks/months delay
- **Compliance**: Automated SAR filing and audit trails

Scene 2: Same Fraudster Tries Bank B (30 mins later)
→ Instant alert: "Known pattern detected"
→ Risk score: 85%
→ Transaction auto-blocked

Scene 3: Regulator Review
→ Audit trail shows decision rationale
